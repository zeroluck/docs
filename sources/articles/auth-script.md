# Writing a Custom Authentication Script

One of the coolest things about the Gluu Server is that you can write very flexible
business logic for authentication. This is accomplished by writing a custom authentication
script. There are a bunch of scripts that Gluu provides out-of-the-box, for example social login
using Google and strong authentication solutions like FIDO U2F tokens and Duo Security.
But if you want to write your own script, this article is for you!

To develop this article, I decided to write a script to use [Twilio](http://twilio.com) to
send an SMS code to implement a two-step out-of-band authentication mechanism.

## Suggested Development Environment

Gluu Server custom scripts are written in Jython. In this article, I'm going to recommend
using Eclipse. You can't actually run the scripts from Eclipse, but it provides a nice editor
which makes coding more enjoyable.

Before you begin, install the following:
 - [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 - [Jython](http://www.jython.org/downloads.html)
 - [Java Standard Edition](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/products/index.html)
 - [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](https://eclipse.org/downloads/)

### Install Eclipse Plugins

PyDev is a useful Eclipse tool for editing Python files. It also support Jython.
To add an Eclipse plugin, the first thing to do to select "Install New Software" from the
Help menu:

After this, you'll need to add the repositories for the software.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/docs/master/sources/img/auth_article/02-Add-Repositories.jpg)

 - PyDev - http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/mars/development/updates/
 - JBoss Tools - http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/mars/development/updates/

Then select the respective repository in the "Work with" dropdown and check the box for the
software you want to install, as in the images below.

And from JBoss Tools, under "JBoss Web and Jave EE Development" select "Jboss Tools RichFaces":

### Create a project

The next thing you'll want to do is to specify the Jython interpreter under the Window / Preferences
menu:

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/docs/master/sources/img/auth_article/05-preferences-jython-interpreter.jpg)

Now you can create a new project to keep all your stuff. From the File menu, create a new PyDev
project

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/docs/master/sources/img/auth_article/06-new-pydev-project.jpg)

Now you'll want to create some files:
 - A Python file for your script
 - Zero or more XHTML files for if you have a custom form for your autethentication
 - Zero or more XML files (you'll need one for each XHTML file) that provides some information to
 the tomcat server about how to display the XHTML file.

## Samples and Documentation

There are many good examples of authentication interception scripts checked into the
[integrations folder](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/tree/master/Server/integrations)
of the oxAuth project. Also, the respective `XHTML` and `XML` files are checked in to the
[auth folder](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/tree/master/Server/src/main/webapp/auth).
The interfaces for the authentication interception can be found in the
[Gluu Documentation](http://www.gluu.org/docs/reference/interception-scripts/#authentication)

When I started my Twilio script, I decided to use the
[Basic Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/master/Server/integrations/basic/BasicExternalAuthenticator.py)
as a template. I also used the [Wikid Forms](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/tree/master/Server/src/main/webapp/auth/wikid)
as my templates for the forms, because I remembered that I'd basically need to get a code in step 2.
I also looked at the
[Wikid Authentication](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/blob/master/Server/integrations/wikid/WikidExternalAuthenticator.py)
script quite a bit for examples of how to process the form.

## Implement methods

The most important method to implement is obviously the `authenticate` method. This is where
the main business logic is for your authentication workflow. Notice how you can switch on the
step, with the `if (step == 1):` statement. In oxAuth, there is no assumption that step 1
and step 2 happen on the same server, so the step is sent into the `authenticate` method.

Another method you usually need to implement is `getCountAuthenticationSteps`. This method
normally just returns 1, 2, or 3. If you are implementing an adaptive authentication strategy,
where the number of steps depends on the context, you need to get a little fancier. Check out
the Duo script for a good example of this. In our sample
[Duo script](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/blob/master/Server/integrations/duo/DuoExternalAuthenticator.py),
the organization we wrote it for only wanted to use Duo for the IT group. So we checked group
membership, and dynamically adjusted the number of steps.

If you need to save session variables between steps, use the `getExtraParametersForStep` method.
The Gluu Server persists these variables in LDAP in able to support stateless clustered two step 
authentications.

If you need to display a special Web page for an interactive login, (or even a custom
first page) you'll need to implement the `getPageForStep` which specifies the page you 
want to return for a given step.

## Custom Properties

Sometimes its helpful to enable system administrators to enter properties that might change a lot.
If you don't want to ask them to modify the script, you can use the Custom Property feature, as seen
in this screenshot:

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/docs/master/sources/img/auth_article/07-custom-properties.jpg)

To access this information in your script with `configurationAttributes.get("<key>").getValue2()`
where `<key>` specifies the value you want to retrieve.

## Returning a message to the user

Its possible to use the Context to return a message to the user, which could be especially
useful if an error happened, or you need some kind of user action.

## Adding Libraries

If you have some pure Python libraries, you can add them to `/opt/tomcat/conf/python`,
jar files can be added to `/opt/tomcat/endorsed`

## Testing

So you think you're done with your script, its time to test it! Print statements are sent to
`/opt/tomcat/wrapper.log` If you prefix your logs, you can use `tail -f | grep <prefix>`
to just see your script output while you try to login to test your script. In the Twilio test
script I wrote a special method called `printOut` to make it easier to add this prefix.

Also, remember that putting all your code in a `try / catch` is a good practice to avoid
unhandled exceptions. But when you're debugging, sometimes those exceptions may give you
a hint as to what's going wrong.
